I tested on several versions of unity to find the one that is causing the problem and it is version 2020.1.0f1
2020.1.17f1: Build failed
2020.1.0f1: Build failed
2019.4.16f1: Build success
2019.4.10f1: Build success
2019.2.17f1: Build success

Here the change log: https://unity3d.com/fr/unity/whats-new/2020.1.0
It may be a regression from this patch https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-loading-assets-from-assetbundles-takes-significantly-more-time-when-the-project-is-built-as-an-aab
